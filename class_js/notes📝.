Classes & Objects.

Objects--
A javaScript object is an entity ahving state and behaviour (properties and method).
JS objects have a special property called prototype.
We can set prototype using _ _ proto _ _
*if object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used.
//
Classes in JS---
Class is a program-code template for creating objects.
Those objects will have some state(variables)& some behaviour (functions)inside it.
class MyClass{
    constructor(){...}
    myMethod(){....}
}
let myObj=new MyClass();
//constructor---
constructor() method is:
automatically invoked by new
initializes objectc
//class MyClass{
     constructor(){...}
    myMethod(){....}
}
//async await>> promise chains >>callback hell.
Synch in JS---
Synchronous---
Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each insruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.
Asynchronous---
Due to synchronous programming,sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions,which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
//setTimeout()
