                <h2>Missile Man of India.</h2>
                <p>
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen (A. P. J.) Abdul
Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was
the11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. A
career scientist turned politician, Kalam was born
and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and
studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
spent the next four decades as a scientist and
science administrator, mainly at the Defence
Research and Development
Organisation (DRDO) and
Indian Space Research
Organisation (ISRO) and was
intimately involved in India’s
civilian space programme and
military missile development
efforts. He thus came to be
known as the Missile Man of
India for his work on the
development of ballistic
missile and launch vehicle technology. He also
played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
political role in India’s Pokhran-II nuclear tests
in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by
India in 1974.
